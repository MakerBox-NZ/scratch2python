[[score]]
Add scorekeeping to your Python game
------------------------------------

If you've followed along with this series, you've learned all the
essential syntax and patterns you need to create a video game with
Python. However, it still lacks one vital component. This component
isn't important just for programming games in Python; it's something you
must master no matter what branch of computing you explore: Learning new
tricks as a programmer by reading a language's or library's
documentation.

Luckily, the fact that you're reading this article is a sign that you're
comfortable with documentation. For the practical purpose of making your
platform game more polished, in this article, you will add a score and
health display to your game screen. But the not-so-secret agenda of this
lesson is to teach you how to find out what a library offers and how you
can use new features.

[[displaying-the-score-in-pygame]]
Displaying the score in Pygame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have loot that your player can collect, there's every
reason to keep score so that your player sees just how much loot they've
collected. You can also track the player's health so that when they hit
one of the enemies, it has a consequence.

You already have variables that track score and health, but it all
happens in the background. This article teaches you to display these
statistics in a font of your choice on the game screen during gameplay.

[[read-the-docs]]
Read the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Python modules have documentation, and even those that do not can
be minimally documented by Python's Help function.
http://pygame.org/news[Pygame's main page] links to its documentation.
However, Pygame is a big module with a lot of documentation, and its
docs aren't exactly written in the same approachable (and friendly and
elucidating and helpful) narrative style as articles on Opensource.com.
They're technical documents, and they list each class and function
available in the module, what kind of inputs each expects, and so on. If
you're not comfortable referring to descriptions of code components,
this can be overwhelming.

The first thing to do, before bothering with a library's documentation,
is to think about what you are trying to achieve. In this case, you want
to display the player's score and health on the screen.

Once you've determined your desired outcome, think about what components
are required for it. You can think of this in terms of variables and
functions or, if that doesn't come naturally to you yet, you can think
generically. You probably recognize that displaying a score requires
some text, which you want Pygame to draw on the screen. If you think it
through, you might realize that it's not very different from rendering a
player or loot or a platform on screen.

Technically, you _could_ use graphics of numbers and have Pygame display
those. It's not the easiest way to achieve your goal, but if it's the
only way you know, then it's a valid way. However, if you refer to
Pygame's docs, you see that one of the modules listed is **font**, which
is Pygame's method for making printing text on the screen as easy as
typing.

[[deciphering-technical-documentation]]
Deciphering technical documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *font* documentation page starts with **pygame.font.init()**, which
it lists as the function that is used to initialize the font module.
It's called automatically by **pygame.init()**, which you already call
in your code. Once again, you've reached a point that that's technically
__good enough__. While you don't know _how_ yet, you know that you _can_
use the *pygame.font* functions to print text on the screen.

If you read further, however, you find that there's yet an even better
way to print fonts. The *pygame.freetype* module is described in the
docs this way:

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The pygame.freetype module is a replacement for pygame.fontpygame module
for loading and rendering fonts. It has all of the functionality of the
original, plus many new features.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Further down the *pygame.freetype* documentation page, there's some
sample code:

....
import pygame
import pygame.freetype
....

Your code already imports Pygame, but modify your *import* statements to
include the Freetype module:

....
import pygame
import sys
import os
import pygame.freetype
....

[[using-a-font-in-pygame]]
Using a font in Pygame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the description of the font modules, it's clear that Pygame uses a
font, whether it's one you provide or a default font built into Pygame,
to render text on the screen. Scroll through the *pygame.freetype*
documentation to find the *pygame.freetype.Font* function:

....
pygame.freetype.Font
Create a new Font instance from a supported font file.

Font(file, size=0, font_index=0, resolution=0, ucs4=False) -> Font

pygame.freetype.Font.name
  Proper font name.

pygame.freetype.Font.path
  Font file path

pygame.freetype.Font.size
  The default point size used in rendering
....

This describes how to construct a font "object" in Pygame. It may not
feel natural to you to think of a simple object onscreen as the
combination of several code attributes, but it's very similar to how you
built your hero and enemy sprites. Instead of an image file, you need a
font file. Once you have a font file, you can create a font object in
your code with the *pygame.freetype.Font* function and then use that
object to render text on the screen.

[[asset-management]]
Asset management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because not everyone in the world has the exact same fonts on their
computers, it's important to bundle your chosen font with your game. To
bundle a font, first create a new directory in your game folder, right
along with the directory you created for your images. Call it **fonts**.

Even though several fonts come with your computer, it's not legal to
give those fonts away. It seems strange, but that's how the law works.
If you want to ship a font with your game, you must find an open source
or Creative Commons font that permits you to give the font away along
with your game.

Sites that specialize in free and legal fonts include:

* https://fontlibrary.org/[Font Library]
* https://www.fontsquirrel.com/[Font Squirrel]
* https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/[League of Moveable Type]

When you find a font that you like, download it. Extract the ZIP or
https://opensource.com/article/17/7/how-unzip-targz-file[TAR] file and
move the *.ttf* or *.otf* file into the *fonts* folder in your game
project directory.

[OS_EMBEDDED_MENU_RIGHT:]You aren't installing the font on your
computer. You're just placing it in your game's *fonts* folder so that
Pygame can use it. You _can_ install the font on your computer if you
want, but it's not necessary. The important thing is to have it in your
game directory, so Pygame can "trace" it onto the screen.

If the font file has a complicated name with spaces or special
characters, just rename it. The filename is completely arbitrary, and
the simpler it is, the easier it is for you to type into your code.

[[using-a-font-in-code]]
Using a font in code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now tell Pygame about your font. From the documentation, you know that
you'll get a font object in return when you provide at least the path to
a font file to *pygame.freetype.Font* (the docs state explicitly that
all remaining attributes are optional):

....
Font(file, size=0, font_index=0, resolution=0, ucs4=False) -> Font
....

Create a new variable called *myfont* to serve as your font in the game,
and place the results of the *Font* function into that variable. This
example uses the *amazdoom.ttf* font, but you can use whatever font you
want. Place this code in your Setup section:

....
font_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)),"fonts","amazdoom.ttf")
font_size = tx
pygame.freetype.init()
myfont = pygame.freetype.Font(font_path, font_size)
....

[[displaying-text-in-pygame]]
Displaying text in Pygame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've created a font object, you need a function to draw the
text you want onto the screen. This is the same principle you used to
draw the background and platforms in your game.

First, create a function, and use the *myfont* object to create some
text, setting the color to some RGB value. This must be a global
function; it does not belong to any specific class. Place it in the
*objects* section of your code, but keep it as a stand-alone function:

....
def stats(score,health):
    myfont.render_to(world, (4, 4), "Score:"+str(score), BLACK, None, size=64)
    myfont.render_to(world, (4, 72), "Health:"+str(health), BLACK, None, size=64)
....

Of course, you know by now that nothing happens in your game if it's not
in the Main loop, so add a call to your *stats* function near the bottom
of the file:

....
    stats(player.score,player.health) # draw text
....

Try your game. If you've been following the sample code in this article
exactly, you'll get an error when you try to launch the game now.

[[interpreting-errors]]
Interpreting errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Errors are important to programmers. When something fails in your code,
one of the best ways to understand why is by reading the error output.
Unfortunately, Python doesn't communicate the same way a human does.
While it does have relatively friendly errors, you still have to
interpret what you're seeing.

In this case, launching the game produces this output:

....
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/tux/PycharmProjects/game_001/main.py", line 41, in <module>
    font_size = tx
NameError: name 'tx' is not defined
....

Python is aserting that the variable *tx* is not defined. You know this
isn't true, because you've used *tx* in several places by now and it's
worked as expected.

But Python also cites a line number. This is the line that caused Python
to stop executing the code. It is _not_ necessarily the line containing
the error.

Armed with this knowledge, you can look at your code in an attempt to
understand what has failed.

Line 41 attempts to set the font size to the value of **tx**. However,
reading through the file in reverse, up from line 41, you might notice
that *tx* (and **ty**) are not listed. In fact, *tx* and *ty* were
placed haphazardly in your setup section because, at the time, it seemed
easy and logical to place them along with other important tile
information.

Moving the *tx* and *ty* lines from your setup section to some line
above line 41 fixes the error.

When you entcounter errors in Python, take note of the hints it
provides, and then read your source code carefully. It can take time to
find an error, even for experienced programmers, but the better you
understand Python the easier it becomes.

[[running-the-game-score]]
Running the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the player collects loot, the score goes up. When the player gets
hit by an enemy, health goes down. Success!

image:img/pygame-score.jpg[]

There is one problem, though. When a player gets hit by an enemy, health
goes _way_ down, and that's not fair. You have just discovered a
non-fatal bug. Non-fatal bugs are those little problems in applications
that don't keep the application from starting up or even from working
(mostly), but they either don't make sense, or they annoy the user.
Here's how to fix this one.

[[fixing-the-health-counter]]
Fixing the health counter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The problem with the current health point system is that health is
subtracted for every tick of the Pygame clock that the enemy is touching
the player. That means that a slow-moving enemy can take a player down
to –200 health in just one encounter, and that's not fair. You could, of
course, just give your player a starting health score of 10,000 and not
worry about it; that would work, and possibly no one would mind. But
there is a better way.

Currently, your code detects when a player and an enemy collide. The fix
for the health-point problem is to detect _two_ separate events: when
the player and enemy collide and, once they have collided, when they
_stop_ colliding.

First, in your Player class, create a variable to represent when a
player and enemy have collided:

....
        self.frame = 0
        self.health = 10
        self.damage = 0
....

In the update function of your Player class, _remove_ this block of
code:

....
        for enemy in enemy_hit_list:
            self.health -= 1
            #print(self.health)
....

And in its place, check for collision as long as the player is not
currently being hit:

....
        if self.damage == 0:
            for enemy in enemy_hit_list:
                if not self.rect.contains(enemy):
                    self.damage = self.rect.colliderect(enemy)
....

You might see similarities between the block you deleted and the one you
just added. They're both doing the same job, but the new code is more
complex. Most importantly, the new code runs only if the player is not
_currently_ being hit. That means that this code runs once when a player
and enemy collide and not constantly for as long as the collision
happens, the way it used to.

The new code uses two new Pygame functions. The *self.rect.contains*
function checks to see if an enemy is currently within the player's
bounding box, and *self.rect.colliderect* sets your new *self.damage*
variable to one when it is true, no matter how many times it is true.

Now even three seconds of getting hit by an enemy still looks like one
hit to Pygame.

I discovered these functions by reading through Pygame's documentation.
You don't have to read all the docs at once, and you don't have to read
every word of each function. However, it's important to spend time with
the documentation of a new library or module that you're using;
otherwise, you run a high risk of reinventing the wheel. Don't spend an
afternoon trying to hack together a solution to something that's already
been solved by the framework you're using. Read the docs, find the
functions, and benefit from the work of others!

Finally, add another block of code to detect when the player and the
enemy are no longer touching. Then and only then, subtract one point of
health from the player.

....
        if self.damage == 1:
            idx = self.rect.collidelist(enemy_hit_list)
            if idx == -1:
                self.damage = 0   # set damage back to 0
                self.health -= 1  # subtract 1 hp
....

Notice that this new code gets triggered _only_ when the player has been
hit. That means this code doesn't run while your player is running
around your game world exploring or collecting loot. It only runs when
the *self.damage* variable gets activated.

When the code runs, it uses *self.rect.collidelist* to see whether or
not the player is _still_ touching an enemy in your enemy list
(**collidelist** returns negative one when it detects no collision).
Once it is not touching an enemy, it's time to pay the *self.damage*
debt: deactivate the *self.damage* variable by setting it back to zero
and subtract one point of health.

Try your game now.

image:img/pygame-health.jpg[]

Now that you have a way for your player to know their score and health,
you can make certain events occur when your player reaches certain
milestones. For instance, maybe there's a special loot item that
restores some health points. And maybe a player who reaches zero health
points has to start back at the beginning of a level.

You can check for these events in your code and manipulate your game
world accordingly.

[[score-reaction]]
Level up
~~~~~~~~

You already know how to do so much. Now it's time to level up your
skills. Go skim the documentation for new tricks and try them out on
your own. Programming is a skill you develop, so don't stop with this
project. Invent another game, or a useful application, or just use
Python to experiment around with crazy ideas. The more you use it, the
more comfortable you get with it, and eventually it'll be second nature.

Keep it going, and keep it open!
