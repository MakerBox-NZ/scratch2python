[[loot]]
Using Python to set up loot in Pygame
-------------------------------------

You now know all the basics of programming video game mechanics.
You can build upon these basics to create a fully functional video game all your own.
Following a "recipe" like the code samples in this series is helpful when you're first learning, but eventually, the recipe becomes a constraint.
It's time to use the principles you've learned and apply them in new ways.

If that sounds easier said than done, this article demonstrates an
example of how to leverage what you already know for new purposes.
Specifically, it covers how to implement a looting system
[OS_EMBEDDED_MENU_RIGHT:]using what you have already learned about
platforms from previous lessons.

In most video games, you have the opportunity to "loot," or collect
treasures and other items within the game world. Loot usually increases
your score or your health or provides information leading to your next
quest.

Including loot in your game is similar to programming platforms. Like
platforms, loot has no user controls, scrolls with the game world, and
must check for collisions with the player sprite.

Before you begin, you must have a loot graphic, such as a coin or a
treasure chest. If you've already downloaded my recommended tile set,
the
https://kenney.nl/assets/simplified-platformer-pack[simplified-platformer-pack
from Kenney.nl], then you can use a diamond or key from that.

[[creating-the-loot-function]]
Creating the loot function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loot is so similar to platforms that you don't even need a Loot class.
You can just reuse the *Platform* class and call the results loot.

Since loot type and placement probably differ from level to level,
create a new function called *loot* in your *Level* class, if you don't
already have one. Since loot items are not platforms, you must also
create a new *loot_list* group and then add loot objects to it. As with
platforms, ground, and enemies, this group is used when checking for
collisions:

....
    def loot(lvl):
        if lvl == 1:
            loot_list = pygame.sprite.Group()
            loot = Platform(tx*9, ty*5, tx, ty, 'loot_1.png')
            loot_list.add(loot)

        if lvl == 2:
            print(lvl)

        return loot_list
....

In this code, I express the location of the loot as multiples of the
tile size: *tx* on the X axis and *ty* for the Y axis. I do this because
i mapped my level on graph paper, so it's easy to just count the squares
on my map and then multiply it by the tile size, rather than calculating
the pixel count. This is especially true for very long levels. You can
hard code the pixel count, if you prefer.

You can add as many loot objects as you like; just remember to add each
one to your loot list. The arguments for the *Platform* class are the X
position, the Y position, the width and height of the loot sprite (it's
usually easiest to keep your loot sprite the same size as all other
tiles), and the image you want to use as loot. Placement of loot can be
just as complex as mapping platforms, so use the level design document
you created when creating the level.

Call your new loot function in the *Setup* section of your script. In
the following code, the first three lines are for context, so just add
the fourth:

....
loot_list = Level.loot(1)
....

As you know by now, the loot won't get drawn to the screen unless you
include it in your main loop. Add this line to your loop:

....
    loot_list.draw(world)
....

Launch your game to see what happens.

Your loot objects are spawned, but they don't do anything when your
player runs into them, nor do they scroll when your player runs past
them. Fix these issues next.

[[scrolling-loot]]
Scrolling loot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like platforms, loot has to scroll when the player moves through the
game world. The logic is identical to platform scrolling. To scroll the
loot forward, add the last two lines:

....
        for e in enemy_list:
            e.rect.x -= scroll
        for l in loot_list:     # loot scroll
            l.rect.x -= scroll  # loot scroll
....

To scroll it backward, add the last two lines:

....
        for e in enemy_list:
            e.rect.x += scroll
        for l in loot_list:     # loot scroll
            l.rect.x += scroll  # loot scroll
....

Launch your game again to see that your loot objects now act like
they're _in_ the game world instead of just painted on top of it.

[[detecting-collisions]]
Detecting collisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with platforms and enemies, you can check for collisions between loot
and your player. The logic is the same as other collisions, except that
a hit doesn't (necessarily) affect gravity or health. Instead, a hit
causes the loot to disappear and increment the player's score.

When your player touches a loot object, you can remove that object from
the **loot_list**. ThisÂ means that when your main loop redraws all loot
items in **loot_list**, it won't redraw that particular object, so it
will look like the player has grabbed the loot.

Add the following code above the platform collision detection in the
*update* function of your *Player* class (the last line is just for
context):

....
     loot_hit_list = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, loot_list, False)
        for loot in loot_hit_list:
            loot_list.remove(loot)
            self.score += 1
        print(self.score)
 
        plat_hit_list = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, plat_list, False)
....

Not only do you remove the loot object from its group when a collision
happens, but you also award your player a bump in score. You haven't
created a score variable yet, so add that to your player's properties,
created in the *__init__* function of the *Player* class. In the
following code, the first two lines are for context, so just add the
score variable:

....
        self.frame = 0
        self.health = 10
        self.score = 0
....

[[applying-what-you-know-loot]]
Applying what you know
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see, you've got all the basics. All you have to do now is use
what you know in new ways. For instance, if you haven't already placed
your enemies in a sensible place, take some time to do that now using
the same method you've used to place platforms and loot.

There are a few more tips in the next article, but in the meantime, use
what you've learned to make a few simple, single-level games. Limiting
the scope of what you are trying to create is important so that you
don't overwhelm yourself. It also makes it easier to end up with a
finished product that looks and feels finished.

Here's all the code you've written for this Python platformer so far:
