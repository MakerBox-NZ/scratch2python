Getting started with Pygame
---------------------------

In my xref:learn-python[first article] in this series, I explained how to use Python to create a simple,
text-based dice game. You also used the Turtle module to generate some
simple graphics. In this article, you start using a module called Pygame
to create a game with graphics.

The Turtle module is included with Python by default. Anyone who's got
Python installed also has Turtle. The same is not true for an advanced
module like Pygame. Because it's a specialized code library, you must
install Pygame yourself. Modern Python development uses the concept of
virtual __environments__, which provides your Python code its own space
to run in, and also helps manage which code libraries your application
uses. This ensures that when you pass your Python application to another
user to play, you know exactly what they need to install to make it
work.

You can manage your Python virtual environment manually, or you can let
your IDE help you. For now, you can let PyCharm do all the work. If
you don't want to use PyCharm,
xref:learn-pip[read László Kiss Kollár's article about managing Python packages].


Introducing the Pygame module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pygame is a library, or __Python module__. It's a collection of common
code that prevents you from having to reinvent the wheel with every new
game you write. You've already used the Turtle module, and you can
imagine how complex that could have been if you'd had to write the code
to create a pen before drawing with it. Pygame offers similar
advantages, but for video games.

A video game needs a setting, a world in which it takes place. In
Pygame, there are two different ways to create your setting:

* Set a background color
* Set a background image

Either way, your background is only an image or a color. Your video game
characters can't interact with things in the background, so don't put
anything too important back there. It's just set dressing.

[[setting-up-your-first-pygame-script]]
Setting up your first Pygame script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start a new Python project, you would normally create a new folder on
your computer and place all your game files go into this directory. It's
vitally important that you keep all the files needed to run your game
inside of your project folder.

PyCharm (or whatever IDE you use) can do this for you.

To create a new project in PyCharm, navigate to the *File* menu and
select **New Project**. In the window that appears, enter a name for
your project (such as **game_001**.) Notice that this project is saved
into a special *PycharmProjects* folder in your home directory. This
ensures that all the files your game needs stays in one place.

When creating a new project, let PyCharm create a new environment using
Virtualenv, and accept all defaults. Enable the option to create a
*main.py* file (and to set up some important defaults.)

image:img/pycharm-new-project_0.jpg[]

After you've clicked the *Create* button, a new project appears in your
PyCharm window. The project consists of a virtual environment (the
*venv* directory listed in the left column) and a demo file called
**main.py**.

Delete all the contents of *main.py* so you can enter your own custom
code. A Python script starts with the file type, your name, and the
license you want to use. Use an open source license so your friends can
improve your game and share their changes with you:

....
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# by Seth Kenlon

## GPLv3
# This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
# modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
# published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
# License, or (at your option) any later version.
#
# This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
# WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
# General Public License for more details.
#
# You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
# along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
....

Then tell Python what modules you want to use. In this code sample, you
don't have to type the # character or anything after it on each line.
The # character in Python represents a __comment__, notes in code left
for yourself and other coders.

....
import pygame  # load pygame keywords
import sys     # let  python use your file system
import os      # help python identify your OS
....

Notice that PyCharm doesn't understand what Pygame is, and underlines it
to mark it as an error. This is because Pygame, unlike sys and os, isn't
included with Python by default. You need to include Pygame in your
project directory before you can use it successfully in code. To include
it, hover your mouse over the word *pygame* until you see a notification
popup explaining the error.

Click the *Install package pygame* link in the alert box, and wait for
PyCharm to install Pygame into your virtual environment.

Once it's installed, the error disappears.

Without an IDE like PyCharm, you can install Pygame into your virtual
environment manually using the *pip* command.

[[code-sections]]
Code sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because you'll be working a lot with this script file, it helps to make
sections within the file so you know where to put stuff. You do this
with block comments, which are comments that are visible only when
looking at your source code. Create four blocks in your code. These are
all comments that Python ignores, but they're good placeholders for you
as you follow along with these lessons. I still use placeholders when I
code, because it helps me organize and plan.

# put variables here

# put Python classes and functions here

# put game loop here
....

Next, set the window size for your game. Keep in mind that not everyone
has a big computer screen, so it's best to use a screen size that fits
on "most" people's computers.

There is a way to toggle full-screen mode, the way many modern video
games do, but since you're just starting out, keep it simple and just
set one size.

....
'''
Variables
'''
worldx = 960
worldy = 720
....

The Pygame engine requires some basic setup before you can use it in a
script. You must set the frame rate, start its internal clock, and start
(using the keyword `init`, for __initialize__) Pygame.

Add these variables:

....
fps   = 40  # frame rate
ani   = 4   # animation cycles
....

Add instructions to start Pygame's internal clock in the Setup section:

....
'''
Setup
'''

clock = pygame.time.Clock()
pygame.init()
....

Now you can set your background.

[[setting-the-background]]
Setting the background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you continue, open a graphics application and create a background
for your game world. Save it as `stage.png` inside a folder called
`images` in your project directory. If you need a starting point, you
can download a set of link:/article/20/1/what-creative-commons[Creative
Commons] backgrounds from
https://kenney.nl/assets/background-elements-redux[kenny.nl].

There are several free graphic applications you can use to create,
resize, or modify graphics for your games.

* https://pinta-project.com/pintaproject/pinta/releases[Pinta] is a
basic, easy to learn paint application.
* http://krita.org[Krita] is a professional-level paint materials
emulator that can be used to create beautiful images. If you're very
interested in creating art for video games, you can even purchase a
series of online https://gumroad.com/l/krita-game-art-tutorial-1[game
art tutorials].
* http://inkscape.org[Inkscape] is a vector graphics application. Use it
to draw with shapes, lines, splines, and Bézier curves.

Your graphic doesn't have to be complex, and you can always go back and
change it later. Once you have a background, add this code in the setup
section of your file:

....
world = pygame.display.set_mode([worldx,worldy])
backdrop = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('images','stage.png'))
backdropbox = world.get_rect()
....

If you're just going to fill the background of your game world with a
color, all you need is:

....
world = pygame.display.set_mode([worldx, worldy])
....

You also must define a color to use. In your setup section, create some
color definitions using values for red, green, and blue (RGB).

....
'''
Variables
'''

BLUE  = (25, 25, 200)
BLACK = (23, 23, 23)
WHITE = (254, 254, 254)

[[look-out-for-errors]]
Look out for errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyCharm is strict, and that's pretty typical for programming. Syntax is
paramount! As you enter your code into PyCharm, you see warnings and
errors. The warnings are yellow and the errors are red.

PyCharm can be over-zealous sometimes, though, so it's usually safe to
ignore warnings. You may be violating the "Python style", but these are
subtle conventions that you'll learn in time. Your code will still run
as expected.

Errors, on the other hand, prevent your code (and sometimes PyCharm)
from doing what you expect. For instance, PyCharm is very insistent that
there's a newline character at the end of the last line of code, so you
*must* press *Enter* or *Return* on your keyboard at the end of your
code. If you don't, PyCharm quietly refuses to run your code.

[[running-the-game-pygame]]
Running the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, you could theoretically start your game. The problem is,
it would only last for a millisecond.

To prove this, save and then run your game.

If you are using IDLE, run your game by selecting `Run Module` from the
Run menu.

If you are using PyCharm, click the `Run file` button in the top right
toolbar.

image:img/pycharm-button-run.jpeg[]

You can also run a Python script straight from a Unix terminal or a
Windows command prompt, as long as you're in your virtual environment.

However you launch it, don't expect much, because your game only lasts a
few milliseconds right now. You can fix that in the next section.

[[looping]]
Looping
~~~~~~~

Unless told otherwise, a Python script runs once and only once.
Computers are very fast these days, so your Python script runs in less
than a second.

To force your game to stay open and active long enough for someone to
see it (let alone play it), use a `while` loop. To make your game remain
open, you can set a variable to some value, then tell a `while` loop to
keep looping for as long as the variable remains unchanged.

This is often called a "main loop," and you can use the term `main` as
your variable. Add this anywhere in your Variables section:

....
main = True
....

During the main loop, use Pygame keywords to detect if keys on the
keyboard have been pressed or released. Add this to your main loop
section:

....
'''
Main loop
'''

while main:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            try:
                sys.exit()
            finally:
                main = False

        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == ord('q'):
                pygame.quit()
            try:
                sys.exit()
            finally:
                main = False
....

Be sure to press *Enter* or *Return* after the final line of your code
so there's an empty line at the bottom of your file.

Also in your main loop, refresh your world's background.

If you are using an image for the background:

....
world.blit(backdrop, backdropbox)
....

If you are using a color for the background:

....
world.fill(BLUE)
....

Finally, tell Pygame to refresh everything on the screen and advance the
game's internal clock.

....
    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(fps)
....

Save your file, and run it again to see the most boring game ever
created.

To quit the game, press `q` on your keyboard.

[[freeze-your-python-environment]]
Freeze your Python environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyCharm is managing your code libraries, but your users aren't going to
run your game from PyCharm. Just as you save your code file, you also
need to preserve your virtual environment.

Go to the *Tools* menu and select **Sync Python Requirements**. This
saves your library dependencies to a special file called
**requirements.txt**. The first time you sync your requirements, PyCharm
prompts you to install a plugin and to add dependencies. Click to accept
these offers.

image:img/pycharm-requirements.jpg[]

A *requirements.txt* is generated for you, and placed into your project
directory.
