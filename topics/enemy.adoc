[[enemy]]
What's a hero without a villain? How to add one to your Python game
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On your journey up to this point, you've learnt how to use Pygame and Python to spawn a playable hero character in an as-yet empty video game world.
But what's a hero without a villain?
It would make for a pretty boring game if you had no enemies, so in this
article, you'll add an enemy to your game and construct a framework for
building levels.

It might seem strange to jump ahead to enemies when there's still more
to be done to make the player sprite fully functional, but you've
learned a lot already, and creating villains is very similar to creating
a player sprite. So relax, use the knowledge you already have, and see
what it takes to stir up some trouble.

For this exercise, you need an enemy sprite. If you haven't downloaded
one already, you can find

[[creating-the-enemy-sprite]]
Creating the enemy sprite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether you realize it or not, you already know how to implement
enemies. The process is similar to creating a player sprite:

1.  Make a class so enemies can spawn.
2.  Create an `update` function for the enemy, and update the enemy in
your main loop.
3.  Create a `move` function so your enemy can roam around.

Start with the class. Conceptually, it's mostly the same as your Player
class. You set an image or series of images, and you set the sprite's
starting position.

Before continuing, make sure you have placed your enemy graphic in your
game project's `images` directory (the same directory where you placed
your player image). In this article's example code, the enemy graphic is
named `enemy.png`.

A game looks a lot better when everything _alive_ is animated. Animating
an enemy sprite is done the same way as animating a player sprite. For
now, though, keep it simple, and use a non-animated sprite.

At the top of the `objects` section of your code, create a class called
Enemy with this code:

....
class Enemy(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """
    Spawn an enemy
    """
    def __init__(self,x,y,img):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('images',img))
        self.image.convert_alpha()
        self.image.set_colorkey(ALPHA)
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.x = x
        self.rect.y = y
....

If you want to animate your enemy, do it the xref:move[same way you animated your player].

[[spawning-an-enemy]]
Spawning an enemy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make the class useful for spawning more than just one enemy by
allowing yourself to tell the class which image to use for the sprite
and where in the world you want the sprite to appear. This means you can
use this same enemy class to generate any number of enemy sprites
anywhere in the game world. All you have to do is make a call to the
class, and tell it which image to use, along with the X and Y
coordinates of your desired spawn point.

Ao you did when spawning a player sprite, add code to designate a spawn
point in the `setup` section of your script:

....
enemy = Enemy(300,0,'enemy.png')    # spawn enemy
enemy_list = pygame.sprite.Group()   # create enemy group 
enemy_list.add(enemy)                # add enemy to group
....

In that sample code, you spawn an enemy by creating a new object (called
`enemy`), at 300 pixels on the X axis and 0 on the Y axis. Spawning the
enemy at 0 on the Y axis means that its top left corner is located at 0,
with the graphic itself descending down from that point. You might need
to adjust these numbers, or the numbers for your hero sprite, depending
on how big your sprites are, but try to get it to spawn in a place you
can reach with your player sprite (accounting for your game's current
lack of vertical movement). In the end, I placed my enemy at 0 pixels on
the Y axis and my hero at 30 pixels to get them boh to appear on the
same plane. Experiment with the spawn points for yourself, keeping in
mind that greater Y axis numbers are lower on the screen.

Your hero graphic had an image "hard coded" into its class because
there's only one hero, but you may want to use different graphics for
each enemy, so the image file is something you can define at sprite
creation. The image used for this enemy sprite is `enemy.png`.

[[drawing-a-sprite-on-screen]]
Drawing a sprite on screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you were to launch your game now, it would run but you wouldn't see
an enemy. You might recall the same problem when you created your player
sprite. Do you remember how to fix it?

To get a sprite to appear on screen, you must add them to your main
loop. If something is not in your main loop, then it only happens once,
and only for a millisecond. If you want something to persist in your
game, it must happen in the main loop.

You must add code to draw all enemies in the enemy group (called
`enemy_list`), which you established in your setup section, on the
screen. The middle line in this example code is the new line you need to
add:

....
    player_list.draw(world)
    enemy_list.draw(world)  # refresh enemies
    pygame.display.flip()
....

Right now, you have only one enemy, but you can add more later if you
want. As long as you add an enemy to the enemies group, it will be drawn
to the screen during the main loop.

Launch your game. Your enemy appears in the game world at whatever X and
Y coordinate you chose.

[[level-one]]
Level one
~~~~~~~~~

Your game is in its infancy, but you will probably want to add a series
of levels, eventually. It's important to plan ahead when you program so
your game can grow as you learn more about programming. Even though you
don't even have one complete level yet, you should code as if you plan
on having many levels.

Think about what a "level" is. How do you know you are at a certain
level in a game?

You can think of a level as a collection of items. In a platformer, such
as the one you are building here, a level consists of a specific
arrangement of platforms, placement of enemies and loot, and so on. You
can build a class that builds a level around your player. Eventually,
when you create more than one level, you can use this class to generate
the next level when your player reaches a specific goal.

Move the code you wrote to create an enemy and its group into a new
function that gets called along with each new level. It requires some
modification so that each time you create a new level, you can create
and place several enemies:

....
class Level():
    def bad(lvl,eloc):
        if lvl == 1:
            enemy = Enemy(eloc[0],eloc[1],'enemy.png') # spawn enemy
            enemy_list = pygame.sprite.Group() # create enemy group 
            enemy_list.add(enemy)              # add enemy to group
        if lvl == 2:
            print("Level " + str(lvl) )

        return enemy_list
....

The `return` statement ensures that when you use the `Level.bad`
function, you're left with an `enemy_list` containing each enemy you
defined.

Since you are creating enemies as part of each level now, your `setup`
section needs to change, too. Instead of creating an enemy, you must
define where the enemy will spawn and what level it belongs to.

....
eloc = []
eloc = [300,0]
enemy_list = Level.bad( 1, eloc )
....

Run the game again to confirm your level is generating correctly. You
should see your player, as usual, and the enemy you added in this
chapter.

[[hitting-the-enemy]]
Hitting the enemy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An enemy isn't much of an enemy if it has no effect on the player. It's
common for enemies to cause damage when a player collides with them.

Since you probably want to track the player's health, the collision
check happens in the Player class rather than in the Enemy class. You
can track the enemy's health, too, if you want. The logic and code are
pretty much the same, but, for now, just track the player's health.

To track player health, you must first establish a variable for the
player's health. The first line in this code sample is for context, so
add the second line to your Player class:

....
        self.frame  = 0
        self.health = 10
....

In the `update` function of your Player class, add this code block:

....
        hit_list = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, enemy_list, False)
        for enemy in hit_list:
            self.health -= 1
            print(self.health)
....

This code establishes a collision detector using the Pygame function
`sprite.spritecollide`, called `enemy_hit`. This collision detector
sends out a signal any time the hitbox of its parent sprite (the player
sprite, where this detector has been created) touches the hitbox of any
sprite in `enemy_list`. The `for` loop is triggered when such a signal
is received and deducts a point from the player's health.

Since this code appears in the `update` function of your player class
and `update` is called in your main loop, Pygame checks for this
collision once every clock tick.

[[moving-the-enemy]]
Moving the enemy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An enemy that stands still is useful if you want, for instance, spikes
or traps that can harm your player, but the game is more of a challenge
if the enemies move around a little.

Unlike a player sprite, the enemy sprite is not controlled by the user.
Its movements must be automated.

Eventually, your game world will scroll, so how do you get an enemy to
move back and forth within the game world when the game world itself is
moving?

You tell your enemy sprite to take, for example, 10 paces to the right,
then 10 paces to the left. An enemy sprite can't count, so you have to
create a variable to keep track of how many paces your enemy has
movedÂ and program your enemy to move either right or left depending on
the value of your counting variable.

First, create the counter variable in your Enemy class. Add the last
line in this code sample:

....
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.x = x
        self.rect.y = y
        self.counter = 0 # counter variable
....

Next, create a `move` function in your Enemy class. Use an if-else loop
to create what is called an __infinite loop__:

* Move right if the counter is on any number from 0 to 100.
* Move left if the counter is on any number from 100 to 200.
* Reset the counter back to 0 if the counter is greater than 200.

An infinite loop has no end; it loops forever because nothing in the
loop is ever untrue. The counter, in this case, is always either between
0 and 100 or 100 and 200, so the enemy sprite walks right to left and
right to left forever.

The actual numbers you use for how far the enemy will move in either
direction depending on your screen size, and possibly, eventually, the
size of the platform your enemy is walking on. Start small and work your
way up as you get used to the results. Try this first:

....
    def move(self):
        '''
        enemy movement
        '''
        distance = 80
        speed = 8

        if self.counter >= 0 and self.counter <= distance:
            self.rect.x += speed
        elif self.counter >= distance and self.counter <= distance*2:
            self.rect.x -= speed
        else:
            self.counter = 0

        self.counter += 1
....

After you enter this code, PyCharm will offer to simplify the "chained
comparison". You can accept its suggestion to optimize your code, and to
learn some advanced Python syntax. You can also safely ignore PyCharm.
The code works, either way.

You can adjust the distance and speed as needed.

The question is: does this code work if you launch your game now?

Of course not! And you know why: you must call the `move` function in
your main loop.

The first line in this sample code is for context, so add the last two
lines:

....
    enemy_list.draw(world) #refresh enemy
    for e in enemy_list:
        e.move()
....

Launch your game and see what happens when you hit your enemy. You might
have to adjust where the sprites spawn so that your player and your
enemy sprite can collide. When they do collide, look in the console of
IDLE or PyCharm to see the health points being deducted.

image:img/pygame-hero-enemy.jpg[]

You may notice that health is deducted for every moment your player and
enemy are touching. That's a problem, but it's a problem you'll solve
later, after you've had more practice with Python.

For now, try adding some more enemies. Remember to add each enemy to the
`enemy_list`. As an exercise, see if you can think of how you can change
how far different enemy sprites move.
