[[platform]]
Add platforms to your platformer game
-------------------------------------

A platformer game needs platforms.

In Pygame, the platforms themselves are
sprites, just like your playable sprite. That's important because having
platforms that are objects makes it a lot easier for your player sprite
to interact with them.

There are two major steps in creating platforms. First, you must code
the objects, and then you must map out where you want the objects to
appear.

[[coding-platform-objects]]
Coding platform objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build a platform object, you create a class called `Platform`. It's a
sprite, just like your xref:add-sprite[`Player` sprite], with many of the same properties.

Your `Platform` class needs to know a lot of information about what kind
of platform you want, where it should appear in the game world, and what
image it should contain. A lot of that information might not even exist
yet, depending on how much you have planned out your game, but that's
all right. Just as you didn't tell your Player sprite how fast to move
until the end of the
xref:move[Movement
article], you don't have to tell `Platform` everything upfront.

In the objects section of your script, create a new class:

....
# x location, y location, img width, img height, img file
class Platform(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, xloc, yloc, imgw, imgh, img):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('images', img)).convert()
        self.image.convert_alpha()
        self.image.set_colorkey(ALPHA)
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.y = yloc
        self.rect.x = xloc
....

When called, this class creates an object onscreen in _some_ X and Y
location, with _some_ width and height, using _some_ image file for
texture. It's very similar to how players or enemies are drawn onscreen.
You probably recognize this same code structure from the Player and
Enemy classes.

The next step is to map out where all your platforms need to appear.

[[the-tile-method]]
The tile method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few different ways to implement a platform game world. In
the original side-scroller games, such as Mario Super Bros. and Sonic
the Hedgehog, the technique was to use "tiles," meaning that there were
a few blocks to represent the ground and various platforms, and these
blocks were used and reused to make a level. You have only eight or 12
different kinds of blocks, and you line them up onscreen to create the
ground, floating platforms, and whatever else your game needs. Some
people find this the easier way to make a game since you just have to
make (or download) a small set of level assets to create many different
levels. The code, however, requires a little more math.

image:img/supertux.png[]

[[the-hand-painted-method]]
The hand-painted method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another method is to make each and every asset as one whole image. If
you enjoy creating assets for your game world, this is a great excuse to
spend time in a graphics application, building each and every part of
your game world. This method requires less math, because all the
platforms are whole, complete objects, and you tell Python where to
place them onscreen.

Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and the code you must use
is slightly different depending on the method you choose. I'll cover
both so you can use one or the other, or even a mix of both, in your
project.

[[level-mapping]]
Level mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapping out your game world is a vital part of level design and game
programming in general. It does involve math, but nothing too difficult,
and Python is good at math so it can help some.

You might find it helpful to design on paper first. Get a sheet of paper
and draw a box to represent your game window. Draw platforms in the box,
labeling each with its X and Y coordinates, as well as its intended
width and height. The actual positions in the box don't have to be
exact, as long as you keep the numbers realistic. For instance, if your
screen is 720 pixels wide, then you can't fit eight platforms at 100
pixels each all on one screen.

Of course, not all platforms in your game have to fit in one
screen-sized box, because your game will scroll as your player walks
through it. So keep drawing your game world to the right of the first
screen until the end of the level.

If you prefer a little more precision, you can use graph paper. This is
especially helpful when designing a game with tiles because each grid
square can represent one tile.

image:img/level-graph-paper.jpg[]

[[coordinates]]
Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have learned in school about the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system[Cartesian
coordinate system]. What you learned applies to Pygame, except that in
Pygame, your game world's coordinates place `0,0` in the top-left corner
of your screen instead of in the middle, which is probably what you're
used to from Geometry class.

image:img/pygame_coordinates.png[]

The X axis starts at 0 on the far left and increases infinitely to the
right. The Y axis starts at 0 at the top of the screen and extends down.

[[image-sizes]]
Image sizes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Mapping out a game world is meaningless if you don't know how big your
players, enemies, and platforms are. You can find the dimensions of your
platforms or tiles in a graphics program. In
https://krita.org/en/[Krita], for example, click on the *Image* menu and
select **Properties**. You can find the dimensions at the very top of
the *Properties* window.

Alternately, you can create a simple Python script to tell you the
dimensions of an image. To do that, you must install a Python module
called Pillow, which provides the Python Image Library (PIL). Add Pillow
to your project's `requirements.txt` file:

....
pygame~=1.9.6
Pillow
....

Create a new Python file in PyCharm and name it `identify`. Type this
code into it:

....
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# GNU All-Permissive License
# Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
# are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright
# notice and this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is,
# without any warranty.

from PIL import Image
import os.path
import sys

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    print(sys.argv[1])
else:
    sys.exit('Syntax: identify.py [filename]')

pic = sys.argv[1]
img = Image.open(pic)
X   = img.size[0]
Y   = img.size[1]

print(X, Y)
....

Click on the *Terminal* tab at the bottom of the PyCharm window to open
a terminal within your virtual environment. Now you can install the
Pillow module into your environment:

....
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirement already satisfied: pygame~=1.9.6 [...]
Installed Pillow [...]
....

Once that is installed, run your script from within your game project
directory:

....
(venv) python ./identify.py images/ground.png
(1080, 97)
....

The image size of the ground platform in this example is 1080 pixels
wide and 97 high.

[[platform-blocks]]
Platform blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you choose to draw each asset individually, you must create several
platforms and any other elements you want to insert into your game
world, each within its own file. In other words, you should have one
file per asset, like this:

image:img/pygame_floating.png[]

You can reuse each platform as many times as you want, just make sure
that each file only contains one platform. You cannot use a file that
contains everything, like this:

image:img/pygame_flattened.png[]

You might want your game to look like that when you've finished, but if
you create your level in one big file, there is no way to distinguish a
platform from the background, so either paint your objects in their own
file or crop them from a large file and save individual copies.

*Note:* As with your other assets, you can use
https://www.gimp.org/[GIMP], http://krita.org[Krita],
http://mypaint.org/about/[MyPaint], or
https://inkscape.org/en/[Inkscape] to create your game assets.

Platforms appear on the screen at the start of each level, so you must
add a `platform` function in your `Level` class. The special case here
is the ground platform, which is important enough to be treated as its
own platform group. By treating the ground as its own special kind of
platform, you can choose whether it scrolls or whether it stands still
while other platforms float over the top of it. It's up to you.

Add these two functions to your `Level` class:

....
def ground(lvl,x,y,w,h):
    ground_list = pygame.sprite.Group()
    if lvl == 1:
        ground = Platform(x,y,w,h,'block-ground.png')
        ground_list.add(ground)

    if lvl == 2:
        print("Level " + str(lvl) )

    return ground_list

def platform( lvl ):
    plat_list = pygame.sprite.Group()
    if lvl == 1:
        plat = Platform(200, worldy-97-128, 285,67,'block-big.png')
        plat_list.add(plat)
        plat = Platform(500, worldy-97-320, 197,54,'block-small.png')
        plat_list.add(plat)
    if lvl == 2:
        print("Level " + str(lvl) )
        
    return plat_list
....

The `ground` function requires an X and Y location so Pygame knows where
to place the ground platform. It also requires the width and height of
the platform so Pygame knows how far the ground extends in each
direction. The function uses your `Platform` class to generate an object
onscreen, and then adds that object to the `ground_list` group.

The `platform` function is essentially the same, except that there are
more platforms to list. In this example, there are only two, but you can
have as many as you like. After entering one platform, you must add it
to the `plat_list` before listing another. If you don't add a platform
to the group, then it won't appear in your game.

*Tip:* It can be difficult to think of your game world with 0 at the
top, since the opposite is what happens in the real world; when figuring
out how tall you are, you don't measure yourself from the sky down, you
measure yourself from your feet to the top of your head.

If it's easier for you to build your game world from the "ground" up, it
might help to express Y-axis values as negatives. For instance, you know
that the bottom of your game world is the value of `worldy`. So `worldy`
minus the height of the ground (97, in this example) is where your
player is normally standing. If your character is 64 pixels tall, then
the ground minus 128 is exactly twice as tall as your player.
Effectively, a platform placed at 128 pixels is about two stories tall,
relative to your player. A platform at -320 is three more stories. And
so on.

As you probably know by now, none of your classes and functions are
worth much if you don't _use_ them. Add this code to your setup section:

....
ground_list = Level.ground(1, 0, worldy-97, 1080, 97)
plat_list = Level.platform(1)
....

And add these lines to your main loop (again, the first line is just for
context):

....
enemy_list.draw(world)  # refresh enemies
ground_list.draw(world)  # refresh ground
plat_list.draw(world)  # refresh platforms
....

[[tiled-platforms]]
Tiled platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tiled game worlds are considered easier to make because you just have to
draw a few blocks upfront and can use them over and over to create every
platform in the game. There are sets of tiles with a
link:/article/20/1/what-creative-commons[Creative Commons license] for
you to use on sites like
https://kenney.nl/assets/simplified-platformer-pack[kenney.nl] and
https://opengameart.org/content/simplified-platformer-pack[OpenGameArt.org].
The simplified-platformer-pack from kenney.nl are 64 pixels square, so
that's the dimension for tiles this article uses. Should you download or
create tiles with a different size, adjust the code as needed.

The `Platform` class is the same as the one provided in the previous
sections.

The `ground` and `platform` in the `Level` class, however, must use
loops to calculate how many blocks to use to create each platform.

If you intend to have one solid ground in your game world, the ground is
simple. You just "clone" your ground tile across the whole window. For
instance, you could create a list of X and Y values to dictate where
each tile should be placed, and then use a loop to take each value and
draw one tile. This is just an example, so don't add this to your code:

....
# Do not add this to your code
gloc = [0,656,64,656,128,656,192,656,256,656,320,656,384,656]
....

If you look carefully, though, you can see all the Y values are always
the same (656, to be specific), and the X values increase steadily in
increments of 64, which is the size of the tile. That kind of repetition
is exactly what computers are good at, so you can use a little bit of
math logic to have the computer do all the calculations for you:

Add this to the setup part of your script:

....
gloc = []
tx   = 64
ty   = 64

i=0
while i <= (worldx/tx)+tx:
    gloc.append(i*tx)
    i=i+1

ground_list = Level.ground( 1,gloc,tx,ty )
....

With this code, regardless of the size of your window, Python divides
the width of the game world by the width of the tile and creates an
array listing each X value. This doesn't calculate the Y value, but that
never changes on flat ground anyway.

To use the array in a function, use a `while` loop that looks at each
entry and adds a ground tile at the appropriate location. Add this
function to your `Level` class:

....
def ground(lvl,gloc,tx,ty):
    ground_list = pygame.sprite.Group()
    i=0
    if lvl == 1:
        while i < len(gloc):
            ground = Platform(gloc[i],worldy-ty,tx,ty,'tile-ground.png')
            ground_list.add(ground)
            i=i+1

    if lvl == 2:
        print("Level " + str(lvl) )

    return ground_list
....

This is nearly the same code as the `ground` function for the
block-style platformer, provided in the previous section, aside from the
`while` loop.

For moving platforms, the principle is similar, but there are some
tricks you can use to make your life easier.

Rather than mapping every platform by pixels, you can define a platform
by its starting pixel (its X value), the height from the ground (its Y
value), and how many tiles to draw. That way, you don't have to worry
about the width and height of every platform.

The logic for this trick is a little more complex, so copy this code
carefully. There is a `while` loop inside of another `while` loop
because this function must look at all three values within each array
entry to successfully construct a full platform. In this example, there
are only three platforms defined as `ploc.append` statements, but your
game probably needs more, so define as many as you need. Of course, some
won't appear yet because they're far offscreen, but they'll come into
view once you implement scrolling.

....
def platform(lvl,tx,ty):
    plat_list = pygame.sprite.Group()
    ploc = []
    i=0
    if lvl == 1:
        ploc.append((200,worldy-ty-128,3))
        ploc.append((300,worldy-ty-256,3))
        ploc.append((500,worldy-ty-128,4))
        while i < len(ploc):
            j=0
            while j <= ploc[i][2]:
                plat = Platform((ploc[i][0]+(j*tx)),ploc[i][1],tx,ty,'tile.png')
                plat_list.add(plat)
                j=j+1
            print('run' + str(i) + str(ploc[i]))
            i=i+1
            
    if lvl == 2:
        print("Level " + str(lvl) )

    return plat_list
....

Of course, this has only created a function to calculate platforms for
each level. You code doesn't invoke the function yet.

In the setup section of your program, add this line:

....
plat_list = Level.platform(1, tx, ty)
....

To get the platforms to appear in your game world, they must be in your
main loop. If you haven't already done so, add these lines to your main
loop (again, the first line is just for context):

....
        enemy_list.draw(world)  # refresh enemies
        ground_list.draw(world) # refresh ground
        plat_list.draw(world)   # refresh platforms
....

Launch your game, and adjust the placement of your platforms as needed.
Don't worry that you can't see the platforms that are spawned offscreen;
you'll fix that soon.

[[applying-what-you-know-platform]]
Applying what you know
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I haven't demonstrated how to place your enemy in your game world, but
apply what you've learnt so far to position the enemy sprite either on a
platform or down on the ground.

Don't position your hero sprite yet. That must be managed by the forces
of gravity (or at least an emulation of it), which you'll learn in the
next two articles.

For now, here's the code so far:
