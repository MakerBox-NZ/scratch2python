  <title>What is open source?</title>
  
<para>
  The term &quot;open source&quot; refers to something people can modify
  and share because its design is publicly accessible.
</para>

<para>
  The term originated in the context of software development to
  designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today,
  however, &quot;open source&quot; designates a broader set of
  values—what we call
  &quot;<ulink url="https://opensource.com/open-source-way">the open
  source way</ulink>.&quot; Open source projects, products, or
  initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange,
  collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency,
  meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
</para>
<para>
  Open source software is software with source code that anyone can
  inspect, modify, and enhance.
</para>
<para>
  &quot;Source code&quot; is the part of software that most computer
  users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can
  manipulate to change how a piece of software—a &quot;program&quot; or
  &quot;application&quot;—works. Programmers who have access to a
  computer program's source code can improve that program by adding
  features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.
</para>
<para>
  Some software has source code that only the person, team, or
  organization who created it—and maintains exclusive control over
  it—can modify. People call this kind of software
  &quot;proprietary&quot; or &quot;closed source&quot; software.
</para>
<para>
  Only the original authors of proprietary software can legally copy,
  inspect, and alter that software. And in order to use proprietary
  software, computer users must agree (usually by signing a license
  displayed the first time they run this software) that they will not do
  anything with the software that the software's authors have not
  expressly permitted. Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop are examples
  of proprietary software.
</para>
<para>
  Open source software is different. Its authors
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/business/13/5/open-source-your-code">make
  its source code available</ulink> to others who would like to view
  that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.
  <ulink url="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</ulink> and the
  <ulink url="http://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation
  Program</ulink> are examples of open source software.
</para>
<para>
  As they do with proprietary software, users must accept the terms of a
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/law/13/1/which-open-source-software-license-should-i-use">license</ulink>
  when they use open source software—but the legal terms of open source
  licenses differ dramatically from those of proprietary licenses.
</para>
<para>
  Open source licenses affect the way people can
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/law/10/10/license-compliance-not-problem-open-source-users">use,
  study, modify, and distribute</ulink> software. In general, open
  source licenses grant computer users
  <ulink url="https://opensource.org/docs/osd">permission to use open
  source software for any purpose they wish</ulink>. Some open source
  licenses—what some people call &quot;copyleft&quot; licenses—stipulate
  that anyone who releases a modified open source program must also
  release the source code for that program alongside it. Moreover,
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/law/13/5/does-your-code-need-license">some
  open source licenses</ulink> stipulate that anyone who alters and
  shares a program with others must also share that program's source
  code without charging a licensing fee for it.
</para>
<para>
  By design, open source software licenses promote collaboration and
  sharing because they permit other people to make modifications to
  source code and incorporate those changes into their own projects.
  They encourage computer programmers to access, view, and modify open
  source software whenever they like, as long as they let others do the
  same when they share their work.
</para>
<para>
  No. Open source technology and open source thinking both benefit
  programmers and non-programmers.
</para>
<para>
  Because early inventors built much of the Internet itself on open
  source technologies—like
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-linux">the Linux
  operating system</ulink> and the
  <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache Web server
  application</ulink>—anyone using the Internet today benefits from open
  source software.
</para>
<para>
  Every time computer users view web pages, check email, chat with
  friends, stream music online, or play multiplayer video games, their
  computers, mobile phones, or gaming consoles connect to a global
  network of computers using open source software to route and transmit
  their data to the &quot;local&quot; devices they have in front of
  them. The computers that do all this important work are typically
  located in faraway places that users don't actually see or can't
  physically access—which is why some people call these computers
  &quot;remote computers.&quot;
</para>
<para>
  More and more, people rely on remote computers when performing tasks
  they might otherwise perform on their local devices. For example, they
  may use online word processing, email management, and image editing
  software that they don't install and run on their personal computers.
  Instead, they simply access these programs on remote computers by
  using a Web browser or mobile phone application. When they do this,
  they're engaged in &quot;remote computing.&quot;
</para>
<para>
  Some people call remote computing &quot;cloud computing,&quot; because
  it involves activities (like storing files, sharing photos, or
  watching videos) that incorporate not only local devices but also a
  global network of remote computers that form an &quot;atmosphere&quot;
  around them.
</para>
<para>
  Cloud computing is an increasingly important aspect of everyday life
  with Internet-connected devices. Some cloud computing applications,
  like Google Apps, are proprietary. Others, like
  <ulink url="https://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</ulink> and
  <ulink url="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</ulink>, are open
  source.
</para>
<para>
  Cloud computing applications run &quot;on top&quot; of additional
  software that helps them operate smoothly and efficiently, so people
  will often say that software running &quot;underneath&quot; cloud
  computing applications acts as a
  &quot;<ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/14/4/why-open-infrastructure-matters">platform</ulink>&quot;
  for those applications. Cloud computing platforms can be open source
  or closed source.
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-openstack">OpenStack</ulink>
  is an example of an open source cloud computing platform.
</para>
<para>
  People prefer open source software to proprietary software for a
  number of reasons, including:
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Control.</emphasis> Many people prefer open
  source software because they
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/13/5/tumblr-open-publishing">have
  more control</ulink> over that kind of software. They can examine the
  code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do,
  and they can change parts of it they don't like. Users who aren't
  programmers also benefit from open source software, because they can
  use this software for any purpose they wish—not merely the way someone
  else thinks they should.
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Training.</emphasis> Other people like open
  source software because it helps them
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/13/6/learning-program-open-source-way">become
  better programmers</ulink>. Because open source code is publicly
  accessible, students can easily study it as they learn to make better
  software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting
  comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people
  discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those
  mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes
  themselves.
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Security.</emphasis> Some people prefer open
  source software because they consider it more
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/government/10/9/scap-computer-security-rest-us">secure</ulink>
  and stable than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and
  modify open source software, someone might spot and correct errors or
  omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. And
  because so many programmers can work on a piece of open source
  software without asking for permission from original authors, they can
  fix, update, and upgrade open source software more
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/government/13/2/bug-fix-day">quickly</ulink>
  than they can proprietary software.
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">Stability.</emphasis> Many users prefer open
  source software to proprietary software for important, long-term
  projects. Because programmers
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/12/9/should-we-develop-open-source-openly">publicly
  distribute</ulink> the source code for open source software, users
  relying on that software for critical tasks can be sure their tools
  won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop
  working on them. Additionally, open source software tends to both
  incorporate and operate according to open standards.
</para>
<para>
  No. This is a
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/education/12/7/clearing-open-source-misconceptions">common
  misconception</ulink> about what &quot;open source&quot; implies, and
  the concept's implications are
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/5/appreciating-full-power-open">not
  only economic</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
  Open source software programmers can charge money for the open source
  software they create or to which they contribute. But in some cases,
  because an open source license might require them to release their
  source code when they sell software to others, some programmers find
  that charging users money for <emphasis>software services and
  support</emphasis> (rather than for the software itself) is more
  lucrative. This way, their software remains free of charge, and they
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/business/14/7/making-your-product-free-and-open-source-crazy-talk">make
  money helping others</ulink> install, use, and troubleshoot it.
</para>
<para>
  While some open source software may be free of charge, skill in
  programming and troubleshooting open source software can be
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/business/16/2/add-open-source-to-your-resume">quite
  valuable</ulink>. Many employers specifically seek to
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/business/16/5/2016-open-source-jobs-report">hire
  programmers with experience</ulink> working on open source software.
</para>
<para>
  At Opensource.com, we like to say that we're interested in the ways
  open source values and principles apply to the world <emphasis>beyond
  software</emphasis>. We like to think of open source as not only a way
  to develop and license computer software, but also an
  <emphasis>attitude</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
  Approaching all aspects of life
  &quot;<ulink url="https://opensource.com/open-source-way">the open
  source way</ulink>&quot; means expressing a willingness to share,
  collaborating with others in ways that are transparent (so that others
  can watch and join too), embracing failure as a means of improving,
  and expecting—even encouraging—everyone else to do the same.
</para>
<para>
  It also means committing to playing an active role in improving the
  world, which is possible only when
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-access">everyone
  has access</ulink> to the way that world is designed.
</para>
<para>
  The world is full of &quot;source
  code&quot;—<ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/11/6/architecture-open-source-applications-learn-those-you">blueprints</ulink>,
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/12/6/open-source-like-sharing-recipe">recipes</ulink>,
  <ulink url="https://opensource.com/life/12/4/day-my-mind-became-open-sourced">rules</ulink>—that
  guide and shape the way we think and act in it. We believe this
  underlying code (whatever its form) should be open, accessible, and
  shared—so many people can have a hand in altering it for the better.
</para>
<para>
  Here, we tell stories about the impact of open source values on all
  areas of
  life—<ulink url="https://opensource.com/resources/open-science">science</ulink>,

  dynamics</ulink>. We're a community committed to telling others how
  the open source way is the <emphasis>best</emphasis> way, because a
  love of open source is just like anything else: it's better when it's
  shared.
