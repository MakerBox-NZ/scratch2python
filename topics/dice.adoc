https://www.python.org/[Python] is an all-purpose programming language
that can be used to create desktop applications, 3D graphics, video
games, and even websites. It's a great first programming language
because it can be easy to learn and it's simpler than complex languages
like C, C++, or Java. Even so, Python is powerful and robust enough to
create advanced applications, and it's used in just about every industry
that uses computers. This makes Python a good language for young and
old, with or without any programming experience.

Installing Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before learning Python, you may need to install it.

**Linux: **If you use Linux, Python is already included, but make sure
that you have Python 3 specifically. To check which version is
installed, open a terminal window and type:

----
python --version
----

Should that reveal that you have version 2 installed, or no version at
all, try specifying Python 3 instead:

----
python3 --version
----

If that command is not found, then you must install Python 3 from your
package manager or software center. Which package manager your Linux
distribution uses depends on the distribution. The most common are *dnf*
on Fedora and *apt* on Ubuntu. For instance, on Fedora, you type this:

----
sudo dnf install python3
----

**MacOS:** If you're on a Mac, follow the instructions for Linux to see
if you have Python 3 installed. MacOS does not have a built-in package
manager, so if Python 3 is not found, install it from
https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/[python.org/downloads/mac-osx].
Although your version of macOS may already have Python 2 installed, you
should learn Python 3.

**Windows:** Microsoft Windows doesn't currently ship with Python.
Install it from
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows[python.org/downloads/windows].
Be sure to select *Add Python to PATH* in the install wizard. Read my
article
xref:python-windows[How to
Install Python on Windows]for instructions specific to Microsoft
Windows.

[[running-an-ide]]
Running an IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To write programs in Python, all you really need is a text editor, but
it's convenient to have an integrated development environment (IDE). An
IDE integrates a text editor with some friendly and helpful Python
features. IDLE 3 and PyCharm (Community Edition) are
link:/resources/python/ides[two options among many] to consider.

[[idle-3]]
IDLE 3
^^^^^^

Python comes with a basic IDE called IDLE.

image:img/idle3.png[][]

It has keyword highlighting to help detect typing errors, hints for code
completion, and a Run button to test code quickly and easily. To use it:

* On Linux or macOS, launch a terminal window and type **idle3**.
* On Windows, launch Python 3 from the Start menu.
** If you don't see Python in the Start menu, launch the Windows command
prompt by typing **cmd** in the Start menu, and type **C:\Windows\py.exe**.
** If that doesn't work, try reinstalling Python. Be sure to select *Add Python to PATH* in the install wizard. Refer to https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html[docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html] for detailed instructions.
** If that still doesn't work, just use Linux. It's free and, as long as
you save your Python files to a USB thumb drive, you don't even have to
install it to use it.

[[pycharm-community-edition]]
PyCharm Community Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download[PyCharm (Community Edition)
IDE] is an excellent open source Python IDE. It has keyword highlighting
to help detect typos, quotation and parenthesis completion to avoid
syntax errors, line numbers (helpful when debugging), indentation
markers, and a Run button to test code quickly and easily.

To use it:

1.  Install PyCharm (Community Edition) IDE. On Linux, it's easiest to
https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.jetbrains.PyCharm-Community[install
it with Flatpak]. Alternatively,
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux[download] the
correct installer version from PyCharm's website and
link:/article/18/1/how-install-apps-linux[install it manually]. On MacOS
or Windows, download and run the installer from the
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download[PyCharm website].
2.  Launch PyCharm.
3.  Create a new project.

[[telling-python-what-to-do]]
Telling Python what to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keywords tell Python what you want it to do. In your new project file,
type this into your IDE:

----
print("Hello world.")
----

* If you are using IDLE, go to the Run menu and select Run module
option.
* If you are using PyCharm, click the Run File button in the left button
bar.

image:img/pycharm-button-run.jpeg[][]

The keyword *print* tells Python to print out whatever text you give it
in parentheses and quotes.

That's not very exciting, though. At its core, Python has access to only
basic keywords, like **print**, **help**, basic math functions, and so
on.

You can use the *import* keyword to load more keywords.

Turtle is a fun module to use. Type this code into your file (replacing
the old code), and then run it:

----
import turtle

turtle.begin_fill()
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.end_fill()
----

See what shapes you can draw with the turtle module.

To clear your turtle drawing area, use the *turtle.clear()*
keyword. What do you think the keyword *turtle.color("blue")* does?

[[advanced-turtle]]
Advanced turtle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can try some more complex code for similar results. Instead of
hand-coding every line and every turn, you can use a **while loop**,
telling Python to do this four times: draw a line and then turn. Python
is able to keep track of how many times it's performed these actions
with a _variable_ called **counter**. You'll learn more about variables
soon, but for now see if you can tell how the *counter* and *while loop*
interact.

----
import turtle as t
import time

t.color("blue")
t.begin_fill()

counter=0

while counter < 4:
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)
    counter = counter+1

t.end_fill()
time.sleep(2)
----

Once you have run your script, it's time to explore an even better
module.

[[learning-python-by-making-a-game]]
link:[Learning Python by making a game]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn more about how Python works and prepare for more advanced
programming with graphics, let's focus on game logic. In this tutorial,
we'll also learn a bit about how computer programs are structured by
making a text-based game in which the computer and the player roll a
virtual die, and the one with the highest roll wins.

[[planning-your-game]]
Planning your game
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before writing code, it's important to think about what you intend to
write. Many programmers
https://opensource.com/article/17/8/doc-driven-development[write simple
documentation] _before_ they begin writing code, so they have a goal to
program toward. Here's how the dice program might look if you shipped
documentation along with the game:

1.  Start the dice game and press Return or Enter to roll.
2.  The results are printed out to your screen.
3.  You are prompted to roll again or to quit.

It's a simple game, but the documentation tells you a lot about what you
need to do. For example, it tells you that you need the following
components to write this game:

* Player: You need a human to play the game.
* AI: The computer must roll a die, too, or else the player has no one
to win or lose to.
* Random number: A common six-sided die renders a random number between
1 and 6.
* Operator: Simple math can compare one number to another to see which
is higher.
* A win or lose message.
* A prompt to play again or quit.

[[making-dice-game-alpha]]
Making dice game alpha
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Few programs start with all of their features, so the first version will
only implement the basics. First a couple of definitions:

A *variable* is a value that is subject to change, and they are used a lot in Python.
Whenever you need your program to "remember" something, you use a variable.
In fact, almost all the information that code works with is stored in variables.
For example, in the math equation **x + 5 = 20**, the variable is __x__, because the letter _x_ is a placeholder for a value.

An *integer* is a number; it can be positive or negative. For example, 1
and -1 are both integers. So are 14, 21, and even 10,947.

Variables in Python are easy to create and easy to work with.
This initial version of the dice game uses two variables: *player* and **ai**.

Type the following code into a new project called **dice_alpha**:

----
import random

player = random.randint(1,6)
ai = random.randint(1,6)

if player > ai :
    print("You win")  # notice indentation
else:
    print("You lose")
----

Launch your game to make sure it works.

This basic version of your dice game works pretty well. It accomplishes
the basic goals of the game, but it doesn't feel much like a game. The
player never knows what they rolled or what the computer rolled, and the
game ends even if the player would like to play again.

This is common in the first version of software (called an alpha
version). Now that you are confident that you can accomplish the main
part (rolling a die), it's time to add to the program.

[[improvingthe-game]]
Improving the game
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this second version (called a beta) of your game, a few improvements
will make it feel more like a game.

[[describe-the-results]]
1. Describe the results
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Instead of just telling players whether they did or didn't win, it's
more interesting if they know what they rolled. Try making these changes
to your code:

----
player = random.randint(1,6)
print("You rolled " + player)

ai = random.randint(1,6)
print("The computer rolled " + ai)
----

If you run the game now, it will crash because Python thinks you're
trying to do math. It thinks you're trying to add the letters "You
rolled" and whatever number is currently stored in the player variable.

You must tell Python to treat the numbers in the player and ai variables
as if they were a word in a sentence (a string) rather than a number in
a math equation (an integer).

Make these changes to your code:

----
player = random.randint(1,6)
print("You rolled " + str(player) )

ai = random.randint(1,6)
print("The computer rolled " + str(ai) )
----

Run your game now to see the result.

[[slow-it-down]]
2. Slow it down
+++++++++++++++

Computers are fast. Humans sometimes can be fast, but in games, it's
often better to build suspense. You can use Python's **time** function
to slow your game down during the suspenseful parts.

----
import random
import time

player = random.randint(1,6)
print("You rolled " + str(player) )

ai = random.randint(1,6)
print("The computer rolls----" )
time.sleep(2)
print("The computer has rolled a " + str(player) )

if player > ai :
    print("You win")  # notice indentation
else:
    print("You lose")
----

Launch your game to test your changes.

[[detect-ties]]
3. Detect ties
++++++++++++++

If you play your game enough, you'll discover that even though your game
appears to be working correctly, it actually has a bug in it: It doesn't
know what to do when the player and the computer roll the same number.

To check whether a value is equal to another value, Python uses **==**.
That's _two_ equal signs, not just one. If you use only one, Python
thinks you're trying to create a new variable, but you're actually
trying to do math.

When you want to have more than just two options (i.e., win or lose),
you can using Python's keyword **elif**, which means __else if__. This
allows your code to check to see whether any one of _some_ results are
true, rather than just checking whether _one_ thing is true.

Modify your code like this:

----
if player > ai :
    print("You win")  # notice indentation
elif player == ai:
    print("Tie game.")
else:
    print("You lose")
----

Launch your game a few times to try to tie the computer's roll.

[[programming-the-final-release]]
Programming the final release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The beta release of your dice game is functional and feels more like a
game than the alpha. For the final release, create your first Python
**function**.

A function is a collection of code that you can call upon as a distinct
unit. Functions are important because most applications have a lot of
code in them, but not all of that code has to run at once. Functions
make it possible to start an application and control what happens and
when.

Change your code to this:

----
import random
import time

def dice():
    player = random.randint(1,6)
    print("You rolled " + str(player) )

    ai = random.randint(1,6)
    print("The computer rolls----" )
    time.sleep(2)
    print("The computer has rolled a " + str(ai) )

    if player > ai :
        print("You win")  # notice indentation
    else:
        print("You lose")

    print("Quit? Y/N")
    continue = input()

    if continue == "Y" or continue == "y":
        exit()
    elif continue == "N" or continue == "n":
        pass
    else:
        print("I did not understand that. Playing again.")
----

This version of the game asks the player whether they want to quit the
game after they play. If they respond with a *Y* or **y**, Python's
*exit* function is called and the game quits.

More importantly, you've created your own function called **dice**. The
dice function doesn't run right away. In fact, if you try your game at
this stage, it won't crash, but it doesn't exactly run, either. To make
the *dice* function actually do something, you have to *call it* in your
code.

Add this loop to the bottom of your existing code. The first two lines
are only for context and to emphasize what gets indented and what does
not. Pay close attention to indentation.

----
    else:
        print("I did not understand that. Playing again.")

# main loop
while True:
    print("Press return to roll your die.")
    roll = input()
    dice()
----

The *while True* code block runs first. Because *True* is always true by
definition, this code block always runs until Python tells it to quit.

The *while True* code block is a loop. It first prompts the user to
start the game, then it calls your *dice* function. That's how the
game starts. When the dice function is over, your loop either runs again
or it exits, depending on how the player answered the prompt.

Using a loop to run a program is the most common way to code an
application. The loop ensures that the application stays open long
enough for the computer user to use functions within the application.
