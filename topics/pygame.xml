    Installing Pygame
  </title>

  <para>
    Before continuing into the exciting world of Pygame, you must
    install it. Python 3, like Linux, has a <firstterm>package
    manager</firstterm>, called <application>pip3</application>, that
    lets you install extra modules from the Internet.

    <title>Linux and BSD</title>

    <para>
      Linux is a great operating system that powers everything from
      super computers to space stations to movie studios. It has two
      important advantages over others&#58; it&#39;s open source, so
      you have access to all the code you run, and it accepts commands
      directly from the user to the operating system itself. While
      there are ways to control Linux through desktop icons and menus,
      it&#39;s often faster to just tell Linux exactly what you want
      it to do. And that&#39;s why many programmers prefer Linux&#58;
      they can tell the computer exactly what to do with just a few
      quickly-typed commands.

      window.

  If you get the message <computeroutput>failed</computeroutput> back,

  command again. Make sure you enter the correct administrative
  password for your computer.

  <para>
    Beneath the non-open source interface of the Mac operating system
    is UNIX, the same technology that powers Linux and BSD. Broadly,
    terminal usage on a Mac is limited compared to what you can do in
    a Linux terminal, but for Python it&#39;s mostly the same.

    To install Pygame with Python 3 on an Apple Mac computer, open a
    terminal window. Use the same command as you would on Linux&#58;
