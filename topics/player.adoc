[[add-sprite]]
Add a playable sprite to your game
----------------------------------

In the xref:learn-python[first article of
this series], I explained how to use Python to create a simple,
text-based dice game. In the second part, I showed you how to build a
game from scratch, starting with xref:get-started[creating the game's environment]. But every game needs a player, and every player
needs a playable character, so that's what you'll do in this third article.

In Pygame, the icon or avatar that a player controls is called a
__sprite__. If you don't have any graphics to use for a player sprite
yet, download the
https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/tree/master/data/images/creatures/tux/small[walk-0.png,
walk-2.png, walk-4.png, and walk-5.png files] from the classic open
source game https://www.supertux.org[Supertux] and rename them hero1.png
to hero4.png Alternately, you can create something for yourself using
http://krita.org[Krita] or http://inkscape.org[Inkscape], or search
https://opengameart.org/[OpenGameArt.org] for other options. Then, if
you didn't already do so in the previous article, create a directory
called `images` within your Python project directory. Put the images you
want to use in your game into the `images` folder.

To make your game truly exciting, you ought to use an animated sprite
for your hero. If you're drawing your characters yourself, this means
you have to draw more assets, but it makes a big difference. The most
common animation is a __walk cycle__, a series of drawings that make it
look like your sprite is walking. The quick and dirty version of a walk
cycle requires four drawings.

image:img/walk-cycle-poses.png[]

Note: The code samples in this article allow for both a static player
sprite and an animated one.

Name your player sprite `hero.png`. If you're creating an animated
sprite for a walk cycle, append a digit after the name, starting with
`hero1.png`. Save you hero image into a directory called `images` in
your Python project directory.

[[create-a-python-class]]
Create a Python class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python, when you create an object that you want to appear on screen,
you create a class.

Near the top of your Python script, in the Objects section, add the code
to create a player.  If you're using a static image with no walk cycle,
use this code (note that this code goes in the `Objects` section of your
file):

....
'''
Objects
'''

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """
    Spawn a player
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.images = []

        img = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('images', 'hero.png')).convert()
        self.images.append(img)
        self.image = self.images[0]
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
....

This code block creates a virtual "object" for Python to use when
referencing your hero sprite. In object-oriented programming, an
"object" is referred to as a __class__. The object template
(specifically, `pygame.sprite.Sprite`) is provided by Pygame. That's
what makes it possible for you to define an image to represent the
player character. If you had to program that from scratch, you'd have to
learn a lot more about Python before you could start creating a game,
and that's the advantage of using a framework like Pygame.

If you have a walk cycle for your playable character, save each drawing
as an individual file called `hero1.png` to `hero4.png` in your
project's `images` folder. Then use a loop to tell Python to cycle
through each file. This is one of the features of object-oriented
programming: each class can have tasks assigned exclusively to it, which
occurs without affecting the "world" around it. In this case, your
player character sprite is programmed to cycle through four different
images to create the illusion of walking, and this can happen regardless
of what else is happening around it.

....

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """
    Spawn a player
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.images = []
        for i in range(1, 5):
            img = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('images', 'hero' + str(i) + '.png')).convert()
            self.images.append(img)
            self.image = self.images[0]
            self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
....

[[bring-the-player-into-the-game-world]]
Bring the player into the game world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that a Player class exists, you must use it to spawn a player sprite
in your game world. If you never call on the Player class, it never
runs, and there will be no player. You can test this out by running your
game now. The game runs just as well as it did at the end of the
previous article, with the exact same results: an empty game world.

To bring a player sprite into your world, you must "call" the Player
class to generate a sprite and then add it to a Pygame sprite group. Add
these lines to your Setup section:

....
player = Player()   # spawn player
player.rect.x = 0   # go to x
player.rect.y = 0   # go to y
player_list = pygame.sprite.Group()
player_list.add(player)
....

Try launching your game to see what happens. Warning: it won't do what
you expect. When you launch your project, the player sprite doesn't
spawn. Actually, it spawns, but only for a millisecond. How do you fix
something that only happens for a millisecond? You might recall from the
previous article that you need to add something to the __main loop__. To
make the player spawn for longer than a millisecond, tell Python to draw
it once per loop.

Change the drawing clause of your main loop to look like this:

....
    world.blit(backdrop, backdropbox)
    player_list.draw(world) # draw player
    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(fps)
....

Launch your game now. Your player spawns!

[[setting-the-alpha-channel]]
Setting the alpha channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on how you created your player sprite, it may have a colored
block around it. What you are seeing is the space that ought to be
occupied by an __alpha channel__. It's meant to be the "color" of
invisibility, but Python doesn't know to make it invisible yet. What you
are seeing, then, is the space within the bounding box (or "hit box," in
modern gaming terms) around the sprite.

image:img/greenscreen.jpg[]

You can tell Python what color to make invisible by setting an alpha
channel and using RGB values. If you don't know the RGB values your
drawing uses as alpha, open your drawing in Pinta or Inkscape and fill
the empty space around your drawing with a unique color, like #00ff00
(more or less a "greenscreen green"). Take note of the color's hex value
(#00ff00, for greenscreen green) and use that in your Python script as
the alpha channel.

Using alpha requires the addition of two lines in your Sprite creation
code. Some version of the first line is already in your code. Add the
other two lines:

....
            img = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('images','hero' + str(i) + '.png')).convert()
            img.convert_alpha()     # optimise alpha
            img.set_colorkey(ALPHA) # set alpha
....

Python doesn't know what to use as alpha unless you tell it.

If you believe your image already has an alpha channel, you can try
setting a variable `ALPHA` to 0 or 255, both of which are common places
for alpha to be stored. One of those may work, but maybe  due to my
background in film production, I prefer to explicitly create and set my
own alpha channel.

[[setting-your-own-alpha]]
Setting your own alpha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Variable section of your code, add this variable definition:

....
ALPHA = (0, 255, 0)
....

In this example code, *0,255,0* is used, which is the same value in RGB
as #00ff00 is in hex. You can get all of these color values from a good
graphics application like http://gimp.org[GIMP], Krita, or Inkscape.
Alternately, you can also detect color values with a good system-wide
color chooser, like https://github.com/KDE/kcolorchooser[KColorChooser]
or https://github.com/stuartlangridge/ColourPicker[ColourPicker].

image:img/kcolor.png[]

If your graphics application is rendering your sprite's background as
some other value, adjust the values of your alpha variable as needed.
If you're new to graphics applications, read xref:gimp-alpha-channel[How to set an alpha channel with GIMP] for detailed instructions.
No matter what you set your alpha value, it will be made "invisible." RGB
values are very strict, so if you need to use 000 for alpha, but you
need 000 for the black lines of your drawing, just change the lines of
your drawing to 111, which is close enough to black that nobody but a
computer can tell the difference.

Launch your game to see the results.
