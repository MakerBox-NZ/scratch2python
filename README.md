# Scratch2Python

Have you outgrown Scratch? Looking to graduate to something more advanced? Learn to make your very own side-scrolling platformer with Python 3 and Pygame.

## How do I read this thing?

This git repository is primarily the place where I work on the code that goes into the book. If all you want to do is read the book so you can learn Python and Pygame, you can download the latest build of the book from the `dist` folder.

## How do hack on this thing?

If you want to learn Docbook, or you see some stupid Python code in this book that you think could be better, then please feel free to clone this repository and send me patches.

To work with this book with the least amount of resistance, you should have:

* Linux
* A good text editor (I use and recommend [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)
* xmllint
* xmlto (you can get by with pure xsltproc)
* fop (if you want to go out to PDf)

The GNUmakefile included in this repo builds to text, HTML, PDF, and EPUB.
