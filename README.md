# Scratch2Python

Have you outgrown Scratch? Looking to graduate to something more
advanced? Learn to make your very own side-scrolling platformer with
Python 3 and Pygame.

## How do I read this thing?

This git repository is primarily the place where I work on the code
that goes into the book. If all you want to do is read the book so you
can learn Python and Pygame, you can download the book from http://opensource.com

Once I feel it's truly ready, I'll also publish the book on Smashwords
or some similar site, too.

## How do I report bugs?

Found an error? report it as an issue on Gitlab. 
I prefer Gitlab because it's fully open source, and you can log in to it using your Github credentials.
However, if you must, you can report issues on Github, too, where this book is mirrored in the interest of redundant backup.

## How do hack on this thing?

Should you see some Python code in this book that you think could be better, please feel free to clone this repository and send me a patch or merge request.

To work with this book with the least amount of resistance, you need:

* Linux
* A good text editor (I use and recommend [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs))
* xmllint
* an asciidoc toolchain (such as Linux doc utils, Asciidoc, or Asciidoctor)
